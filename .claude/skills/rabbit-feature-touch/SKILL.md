## Overview

The main session's role is **orchestration only**: resolve scope, create branch,
dispatch TDD subagents, verify HANDOFFs. It does NOT read feature code.

**Two modes:**
- **Normal mode** — invoked directly for a feature work request
- **B/B mode** — invoked by the bug or backlog skill, which passes a bug/item dir

## Unified Five-Step Sequence

All modes follow these five steps. Mode determines branch name and step 5 behaviour.

### Step 1 — Scope Resolution

**Normal mode:** Invoke `rabbit-feature-scope` via the Skill tool:
```
Skill("rabbit-feature-scope", args: "<request>")
# Parse JSON response: {"features": [...], "rationale": "..."}
```

**B/B mode:** Skip — feature name comes from `related_feature` in the bug/item JSON:
```bash
FEATURE=$(jq -r '.related_feature' "<bug-or-item-dir>/bug.json")
```

### Step 2 — Create Branch

Create before any dispatch. Never write to main.

| Mode | Branch pattern |
|---|---|
| Normal, single feature | `feat/<feature-name>-<keywords>` |
| Normal, multi-feature | `feat/<primary-feature>-multi-<keywords>` (primary = first feature in scope response) |
| Bug fix (B/B) | `fix/<bug-id>-<keywords>` |
| Backlog task (B/B) | `task/<backlog-id>-<keywords>` |

`<keywords>` = 2–4 words from the request, hyphenated, lowercase.

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

### Step 3 — Dispatch TDD Subagents

One subagent per feature. Dispatch all in parallel if multiple features.

```bash
# For each feature:
PROMPT=$(python3 .claude/features/tdd-state-machine/scripts/dispatch-feature-tdd.py \
  <feature-name> "<request>" \
  [--linked-item <bug-or-item-dir> --item-type <bug|backlog>])
# Dispatch Agent(prompt: PROMPT)
```

Each subagent: sets `.rabbit-scope-active-<feature>`, runs full TDD cycle
(spec-update → test-red → impl → inline spec-review → test-green), writes
`tdd-report.json` to `.rabbit/tdd-report.json` (hidden folder at repo root), emits HANDOFF.

### Step 4 — Collect and Verify HANDOFFs

Verify each HANDOFF:
- `tdd_state: test-green` for every feature
- `test_result: pass` for every feature
- `spec_compliance: pass` (investigate if fail before proceeding)

If any feature fails: surface failure to user. Do NOT proceed to step 5.

### Step 5 — PR / Hand Off

**Normal mode:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "<summary>" --body "<tdd report highlights>"
```
Summarize the TDD report to the user.

**B/B mode:** Commit code to branch. Hand off to calling skill:
```
{
  "mode": "bug|backlog",
  "linked_item": "<path>",
  "feature": "<name>",
  "branch": "<branch-name>",
  "tdd_report_path": "<repo-root>/.rabbit/tdd-report.json",
  "status": "success|failed"
}
```

If `status: failed`, calling skill surfaces the failure before any item close.
PR creation is the calling skill's responsibility in B/B mode.

## Red Flags — STOP

- Reading feature code directly in the main session → STOP. Subagent's job.
- Skipping scope resolution in normal mode → STOP.
- Dispatching features sequentially when multiple → STOP. Use parallel.
- HANDOFF shows `tdd_state ≠ test-green` → STOP and investigate.

## Override Path

When user explicitly approves a lightweight edit (typo, comment-only), present
a confirm token with `one-time` or `session` scope. After approval, write
`.rabbit-scope-override`, make the edit directly. Does NOT reset `tdd_state`.
