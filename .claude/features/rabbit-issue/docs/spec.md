# rabbit-issue

> Structured source of truth is [`feature.json`](../feature.json).

## Purpose

Wrap the `gh` CLI to provide rabbit's file / list / work / show operations
against GitHub Issues. GitHub Issues is rabbit's issue store for bugs and
enhancements; rabbit-issue owns the file / list / work / show surface over it.

## Schema / Behavior

### Surface

Three runtime scripts under `.claude/features/rabbit-issue/scripts/`:

- `file-item.py` — file a new bug or enhancement issue
- `item-status.py` — show, close, or reopen an issue
- `list-items.py` — list issues with type / feature / status filters

Plus a shared helper module `_gh.py`.

A single `rabbit-issue` skill (under `skills/rabbit-issue/SKILL.md`)
defines the Work Protocol that orchestrates the three runtime scripts.

### Label schema

Every issue filed via `rabbit-issue` carries the type, `feature:`, and
`priority:` labels; the `filed-by:` provenance label is optional (present
only for non-human filers), and the `housekeeping` category label is
optional (present only when the filer marks the issue as housekeeping work):

| Label | Purpose | Cardinality |
|---|---|---|
| `bug` *(GH default)* | Type — exclusive with `enhancement` | exactly one of bug/enhancement |
| `enhancement` *(GH default)* | Type — exclusive with `bug` | exactly one of bug/enhancement |
| `feature:<name>` | Feature scope | required, one per item |
| `priority:<low\|medium\|high\|critical>` | Priority | required, one per item |
| `filed-by:<rabbit\|autonomous-evolve>` | Provenance — non-human filer | optional; absent ⇒ human-filed |
| `housekeeping` | Category — housekeeping-wave work | optional; present ⇒ housekeeping sub-issue |

Labels are auto-created on demand at first `file-item.py` call via
idempotent `gh label create … || true`. No separate bootstrap script.

### Provenance label

The `filed-by:` provenance scheme is a **fixed enum** with exactly two
non-human values:

| Filer | `--filed-by` value | Label stamped |
|---|---|---|
| Human | *(omit `--filed-by`)* | none — human is the untagged default |
| Bot / wrapped rabbit script | `rabbit` | `filed-by:rabbit` |
| Autonomous evolve loop | `autonomous-evolve` | `filed-by:autonomous-evolve` |

`file-item.py` VALIDATES `--filed-by` against the enum `{rabbit,
autonomous-evolve}`. Human provenance is expressed by OMITTING
`--filed-by`, in which case no `filed-by:` label is stamped. Any explicit
value outside the enum — including the literal `human` or any
space-bearing/polluted value — is REJECTED with a clear error before any
gh call. Validation guarantees only the two enum values plus the untagged
human default ever reach the label set; malformed, space-bearing
provenance values cannot enter the system.

The label is additive — when present it does not change any of the other
labels. Provenance keeps loop-performance metrics (self-discovery rate,
discovery→fix ratio) answerable by querying the
`filed-by:autonomous-evolve` label.

### Housekeeping label

`housekeeping` is a sanctioned category label marking an issue as
housekeeping-wave work. It is applied at filing time in one deterministic
step via the `--housekeeping` flag on `file-item.py`:

| Flag | Label stamped |
|---|---|
| *(omit `--housekeeping`)* | none |
| `--housekeeping` | `housekeeping` |

The flag is a boolean switch: when passed, `file-item.py` adds the
`housekeeping` label to the created issue's label set in the same
`gh issue create` call; when omitted, no `housekeeping` label is stamped.
The label is additive — it does not change any of the other labels. This
gives the housekeeping-wave filing path a first-class, single-step way to
tag a sub-issue, with no ad-hoc post-filing `gh issue edit --add-label`
dance.

### Safety invariant

`item-status.py close` and `item-status.py reopen` refuse to act on
issues that are NOT **actionable** — an actionable issue is one carrying
a valid `feature:<name>` label. A raw, hand-filed GitHub issue with no
labels (or only stray labels) lacks a `feature:` label, so it is not
actionable and stays out of rabbit's automation reach. This is the same
actionability basis the queue itself uses to decide what is workable, so
the guard and the queue agree on which issues are subject to automation.

### Lifecycle

- `state` is GH's binary `open` / `closed`
- `state_reason` ∈ {`completed`, `not_planned`, `null`}
  - `completed` — closed after TDD fix (default close reason)
  - `not_planned` — closed without work (stale or invalid issue)
- `item-status.py close --reason` accepts the hyphenated, shell-friendly
  forms `completed` and `not-planned`; the script translates `not-planned`
  to gh's space-separated `not planned` at the CLI boundary, which GitHub
  records as `state_reason = not_planned`.
- **Close-reason gating.** A close must assert something real:
  - `--reason completed` REQUIRES `--commit-sha <sha>`. The script
    validates that the SHA resolves to a real commit in the local git
    repo (`git rev-parse --verify <sha>^{commit}`). A missing or
    unresolvable SHA aborts the close before any gh call.
  - `--reason not-planned` REQUIRES `--reason-text <text>` of at least
    50 characters, free of reflexive-deferral boilerplate. The script
    rejects (case-insensitive substring match) any of: `too risky`,
    `out of scope`, `out-of-scope`, `declined autonomous dispatch`,
    `not now`, `later`, `don't want`, `do not want`. A specific reason
    that is long enough and clean is accepted.
  - **The validated `--reason-text` is PERSISTED, not just gated.** A
    `not-planned` close posts the reason-text as the close comment so the
    closed issue carries its justification as an audit trail. When
    `--comment` is also supplied, the close comment is the
    reason-text followed by the comment (reason-text first, separated by a
    blank line); when only `--reason-text` is given it is the close comment
    on its own. The comment travels with the same `gh issue close` call.
  - The actionability guard runs first (the safety boundary), then
    the reason gating, then the gh call — so a rejected close never
    issues `gh issue close` and never touches a non-actionable issue.
- Reopen restores `state = open`, `state_reason = reopened`

### SHA / event history

Delegated entirely to GitHub's Timeline API. No local `history` array,
no `--fix-commits` parameter. The "closing reference" feature
(`Fixes #N` in commit messages) auto-links commits to issue closure
and records the SHA in the timeline event.

### Repository discovery

`rabbit-issue` ALWAYS targets the upstream rabbit-workflow repo,
regardless of the cwd's git remote. Bugs about rabbit go to rabbit's
repo, period — never to the user's project repo.

`_gh.py` resolves the target repo slug as:

1. The `RABBIT_ISSUE_REPO` environment variable when set (override for
   forks, testing, etc. — e.g. `RABBIT_ISSUE_REPO=myfork/rabbit-workflow`).
2. Otherwise the const `RABBIT_REPO_DEFAULT = "changyu87/rabbit-workflow"`
   declared at module top in `_gh.py`.

`_gh.py` does NOT call `git remote get-url origin` at any point — in
plugin installs the cwd is the user's project, which would silently
direct bugs to the wrong target.

Scripts still fail loudly when `gh auth status` is not green.

### Reading issue comments

When rabbit-issue needs to read an issue's comment bodies, it MUST go
through the JSON API — `gh issue view <N> --json comments` — and parse
the returned JSON, NOT the human-readable `gh issue view <N> --comments`
view.

`gh issue view <N> --comments` triggers a deprecated Projects-classic
`projectCards` GraphQL field on repos that touch that path. On this repo
that request FAILS and returns an EMPTY body, so comments appear absent
even when they are present — a silent correctness trap. The
`--json comments` path does NOT hit the deprecated field and returns the
comment bodies reliably; `_gh.py` exposes `gh_issue_comments(number)` as
the only sanctioned comment-read path.

## What this feature does NOT define

- **Branch-backed item storage** — out of scope; GH Issues is the
  backing store and the GH Timeline owns history.
- **GH Projects v2 boards / kanban / sub-status workflows** — out of
  scope; if needed, file a separate issue.
- **Cross-tracker abstractions** (Linear, Jira, etc.) — only `gh` is
  supported in v1.
- **User-install plugin-mode backend** — the original framing for this
  was scoped to user installs and is deferred until rabbit-self validates
  the design. The install MVP does not ship `rabbit-issue` yet.
- **The TDD cycle** — `rabbit-feature-touch` (in `rabbit-feature`)
  drives TDD; the Work Protocol invokes it via its default full
  seven-step TDD cycle (NOT the lightweight Override Path), passing the
  issue title + body as the request text. `rabbit-issue` does not own
  that cycle and does not invent a "normal mode" / "issue mode" of it —
  `rabbit-feature-touch` defines no such mode.

## Tests

`test/run.py` runs the end-to-end suite. The suite uses a `gh` CLI
shim (`test/gh_shim.sh`) on `PATH` to avoid hitting real GitHub
during unit tests.
