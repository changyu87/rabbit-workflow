"""contract.lib.runtime — API library for the runtime APIs invoked by the
per-event dispatcher hooks (Stop, SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit). Each
function implements one runtime API call declared in a feature's RUNTIME
section and returns one or more typed result dicts.

Return-type vocabulary (built via the four factory helpers below):
    print   {"type": "print",  "text": str, "icon": str, "color": str}
    inject  {"type": "inject", "content": str}
    ok      {"type": "ok"}
    error   {"type": "error", "message": str}

Functions that may emit both a print and an inject return a list of two
results in [print, inject] order. The single-result APIs return one dict.
The iterate_configurables_* APIs always return a (possibly empty) list of
print results.

Path-arg convention: every path arg accepted by these APIs is repo-root-
relative unless explicitly noted. (This differs from lib.producers, which
resolves relative paths against feature_dir.)

Version: 1.0.0
Owner: rabbit-workflow team (contract)
Deprecation criterion: when the rabbit CLI exposes native per-event
    dispatchers that subsume this library.
