"""contract.lib.policy_block — canonical policy-block framing renderer.

Holds the sentinel line, header banner, per-file section separator
convention, and footer banner used by every policy-block consumer
(scripts/policy-block.py and scripts/build-prompt.py).

The canonical framing is the ONLY policy-block contract. Inlining these
strings elsewhere is a drift hazard: two copies will diverge silently and
downstream prompt parsers (e.g. the Stop hook's sentinel check) will miss
matches. Every producer of policy-block-framed content MUST route through
render_policy_block.

Public API:
  render_policy_block(paths: list[str]) -> str
      Returns the canonical policy block: sentinel line, header banner,
      one section per path (separator line of '──────── <basename> ────────'
      plus the file's full contents), and the footer banner. Raises
      FileNotFoundError if any path does not exist.

Per spec Inv 54.

Version: 1.0.0
Owner: rabbit-workflow team (contract)
Deprecation criterion: when Claude Code exposes a native policy-injection
    mechanism that replaces the rabbit policy-block contract.
