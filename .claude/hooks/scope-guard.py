"""scope-guard.py v2.5.0 — PreToolUse hook enforcing repo-wide default-deny.

Standalone mode (legacy): any write inside the repo root is denied unless:
  (a) the target basename is on the filename allowlist, or
  (b) a .rabbit-scope-active marker exists in some ancestor of the target, or
  (c) a .rabbit-scope-active-<feature> per-feature marker exists at repo root
      and the target is inside that feature's directory, or
  (d) a .rabbit-scope-override file at repo root grants a bypass: session
      (any write, marker retained), one-time (any single write, consumed), or
      the file-scoped one-time:<repo-relative-path> form (a single write to
      ONLY the declared path, consumed; preferred least-privilege variant).

Plugin mode (Inv 17): when <repo_root>/.rabbit/.runtime/mode contains the
literal string "plugin", scope-guard takes a different branch — see
plugin_decide(). Detection happens per-invocation by reading the mode file.

Pre-evaluation (Inv 18): before any decision logic in either mode, the
one-shot bypass-once marker .rabbit/.runtime/scope-bypass-once is consumed
(deleted) if present, and the current write is ALLOWED unconditionally.
Consume-before-evaluate so a failed edit cannot leave a persistent bypass.

Writes outside the repo root are unrestricted.
The .rabbit-scope-active marker file itself is always exempt.
