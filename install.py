"""install.py — install rabbit in vendored mode at <project>/.rabbit/ + dev-test helper.

This module has two distinct roles:

  1. User-facing MVP installer (main()):
     Invoked by install.sh after the upstream tarball is extracted. Lays
     down the minimum file closure needed for the user-promised surfaces:

       1. Drift-protected Claude on session start (policy block via CLAUDE.md)
       2. rabbit-feature-scaffold <name> <path-glob> (declare a feature mapping)
       3. Scope-guard blocking edits to declared-feature paths
       4. .rabbit/.runtime/scope-bypass-once one-shot override marker

     Each (source, dest) tuple at module top is explicit so the installer
     doesn't depend on the publish flow having been run against the source
     tarball.

     After the closure copy, main() RUNS THE PUBLISH FLOW against the freshly
     installed tree (canonicalize_installed_surfaces) so the installed manifest
     surfaces are byte-identical to what the Stop hook's check_manifest_drift
     republishes at runtime. This makes a fresh install drift-free on its first
     Stop even when a committed deployed surface shipped stale.

     Excludes development surfaces: test/, docs/, scripts/enforcement/,
     deferred features (tdd-subagent), retired
     tombstones (tdd-state-machine).

     Usage:
         install.py --src <extracted-tarball-dir> --target <project>/.rabbit
         install.py --update    (self-fetch upstream; infer target from script
                                 location — see Inv 22g)

  2. Publish flow (run_publish_loop()):
     Walks every <target>/.claude/features/*/feature.json manifest and invokes
     each declared API via contract.lib.publish. Invoked from main() (via
     canonicalize_installed_surfaces) to canonicalize installed surfaces, and
     also imported directly by rabbit-cage test suites
     (test-deployed-hooks-execute.py, test-install-publish-loop.py) to exercise
     the publish flow against a freshly copied .claude tree.

    # TOLERATED closure SHRINK — dropped, not aborted. The refresh proceeds to

    # with the re-exec guard set and its OWN corrected closure: a path the NEW
    # closure REQUIRES but the NEW source omits is a real dangling ref and
